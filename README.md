- ⚡ Fun fact: In 2017, I embarked on an enriching cultural exchange experience to Australia.
               This immersion not only improved my English language proficiency,
               but also provided an in-depth understanding of the local culture.
               This international experience broadened my perspective and my ability to
               collaborate effectively in multiculturally diverse environments.
